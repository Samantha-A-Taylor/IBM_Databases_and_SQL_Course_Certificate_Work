## Introduction
The following repository contains my real-world dataset final project for the *Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python* Certificate Course by IBM (https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science/).

**Learning targets:**

     ✓ Mastery of core and intermediate SQL operations, including foundational commands, filtering techniques, table 
       creation, and the distinction between DML and DDL
     ✓ Proficiency in querying and manipulating data using subqueries, multi-table operations, joins, and built-in 
       database functions
     ✓ Application of SQL within data science workflows using Jupyter notebooks, Python integration, and cloud-based 
       database environments
     ✓ Experience with advanced database concepts such as stored procedures, views, and ACID transactions through 
       hands-on labs and real-world practice
