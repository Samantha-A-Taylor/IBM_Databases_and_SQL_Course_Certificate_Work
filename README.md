The following repository contains my final real-world dataset project for the *Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python* Certificate Course by IBM (https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science/).

     The learning targets 
     * Analyze data within a database using SQL and Python.
     * Create a relational database and work with multiple tables using DDL commands. 
     * Construct basic to intermediate level SQL queries using DML commands. 
     * Compose more powerful queries with advanced SQL techniques like views, transactions, stored procedures, and joins.
